		  constrained resources. We present a novel algorithm and the
		  supporting framework that improves a poller-pollee based
		  architecture. We empower the poller-pollee placement
		  decision process and operation by exploiting available
		  routing data to monitor nodes status. In addition,
		  monitoring data is efficiently embedded in any messages
		  flowing through the network, drastically reducing
		  monitoring overhead. Our approach is validated through both
		  simulation, implementation and deployment on a
		  6LoWPAN-enabled network. Results demonstrate that our

		  As WSN devices are most of the time constrained in energy
		  and processing, we present a caching architecture that will
		  help reducing unnecessary communications and adapting the
		  network to application needs. Our aim here is to cache
		  information in order to improve the overall network
		  lifetime, while meeting requirements of external
		  applications in terms information freshness. We first
		  describe and evaluate the performance of our caching system
		  using a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)-HTTP proxy.
		  We then extend this work by showing how the cache could be
		  enriched and exploited using cross-layer data. Based on
		  information from routing packets and estimations of nodes
		  power consumption, we derive an optimization strategy which
		  allows to either maximize the user satisfaction, expressed
		  in terms of freshness of cached data, in the presence of
		  constraints on network lifetime, or jointly maximize
		  network lifetime and user satisfaction, obtaining a set of
		  non-dominated Pareto optimal solutions.}},

		  this paper, we compare the performance of the two protocols

		  point-to-multipoint routes in realistic dense non-uniform
		  network topologies. We use Contiki OS and Cooja simulator

		  and a basic non-optimized implementation of LOADng. Unlike
		  previous studies, our results show that RPL provides
		  shorter delays, less control overhead, and requires less

		  more efficient flooding and a better route storage
		  algorithm may improve its performance.}},
