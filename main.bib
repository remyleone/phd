  Abstract                 = {{Monitoring constrained, low power and lossy networks is essential to many operations including troubleshooting, forensics, performance management. The main challenge for the monitoring plane in these networks is to efficiently cope with both frequently changing topologies and constrained resources. We present a novel algorithm and the supporting framework that improves a poller-pollee based architecture. We empower the poller-pollee placement decision process and operation by exploiting available routing data to monitor nodes status. In addition, monitoring data is efficiently embedded in any messages flowing through the network, drastically reducing monitoring overhead. Our approach is validated through both simulation, implementation and deployment on a 6LoWPAN-enabled network. Results demonstrate that our approach is less aggressive and less resource consuming than its competitors.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper addresses monitoring and surveillance applications using Wireless Sensors Networks (WSNs). In this context, several remote clients are interested in receiving the information collected by the nodes of a WSN. As WSN devices are most of the time constrained in energy and processing, we present a caching architecture that will help reducing unnecessary communications and adapting the network to application needs. Our aim here is to cache information in order to improve the overall network lifetime, while meeting requirements of external applications in terms information freshness. We first describe and evaluate the performance of our caching system using a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)-HTTP proxy. We then extend this work by showing how the cache could be enriched and exploited using cross-layer data. Based on information from routing packets and estimations of nodes power consumption, we derive an optimization strategy which allows to either maximize the user satisfaction, expressed in terms of freshness of cached data, in the presence of constraints on network lifetime, or jointly maximize network lifetime and user satisfaction, obtaining a set of non-dominated Pareto optimal solutions.}},

  Abstract                 = {{RPL, the routing protocol proposed by IETF for IPv6/6LoWPAN Low Power and Lossy Networks has significant complexity. Another protocol called LOADng, a lightweight variant of AODV, emerges as an alternative solution. In this paper, we compare the performance of the two protocols in a Home Automation scenario with heterogenous traffic patterns including a mix of multipoint-to-point and point-to-multipoint routes in realistic dense non-uniform network topologies. We use Contiki OS and Cooja simulator to evaluate the behavior of the ContikiRPL implementation and a basic non-optimized implementation of LOADng. Unlike previous studies, our results show that RPL provides shorter delays, less control overhead, and requires less memory than LOADng. Nevertheless, enhancing LOADng with more efficient flooding and a better route storage algorithm may improve its performance.}},
